*Basic Description:*
Leads outline and maintain a prioritized list of tasks to be performed and provide the technical direction for the project in collaboration with the overall team, beginning with data collection and ending with report generation. In addition, Leads are tasked with communicating these needs out to the team, and jockeying for individuals to jump into each of the needs to own.

These tasks can range in scope, and can be as self-contained as asking for a specific formatting of data or as wide-ranging as hunting down entire datasets to be analyzed. In short, Leads will own the overall analytical process.

In addition to coordinating within the team, the Lead will work in conjunction with the participating organization and act as the point of contact, if applicable. 

Lastly, the Lead will actively communicate progress with both the Facilitator and Ambassador to keep them aware and will work with them on any needs they may have from the larger D4D community.

*Role Candidates:*
Volunteers who are willing to commit to a substantial amount of time (say, 10+ hours/week) on a specific project and manage that project from scoping through completion
Project leads should have experience planning and implementing collaborative projects and enough technical knowledge to coordinate the work of contributors with varied skillsets
