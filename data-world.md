## Getting Started with data.world

* Signup for an account on data.world, and let @jonathon or @sharon know so we can add you as a contributor. This will grant you upload privileges to https://data.world/data4democracy/
* When you have a dataset you'd like to share publicly or collaborate on with other volunteers, upload it through the data.world UI.
* You can explore the data on data.world, but probably more interesting to us is that you can use their API to send SQL queries and get CSVs (and, subsequently, dataframes!) back!
* Here's a blog post that explains how to use the API https://meta.data.world/apis-at-data-world-cfa1e308bdc8#.o3yxnbnge Coming very soon - the ability to upload data via the API as well!
* Now all the datasets for a project can live in one place. You can comment on them, annotate them, access them programmatically. Boom!
* Lots of the data.world team are actually in the community volunteering on various projects, but if have technical questions and aren't sure who to get in touch with, just join the #tools-support channel and ask the room.
Let me know if you have any questions or if there's anything I can help with!
